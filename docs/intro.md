# Introduction

Welcome to **SolanaFM**.
Explore our how-to guides, example codes using the SolanaFM API.
SolanaFM is the only project to fully index the entire Solana Blockchain & provides easy access to Solana's blockchain and data. 

## Getting to know Solana's deep Infrastructure

Solana's documentation can be found here (https://docs.solana.com/).

## So what exactly is an indexer?

#### An indexer is a GUI-less application that: 
1. Fetches **raw** blockchain data from a fully synced node
2. Processes the raw data into a **queryable** (such as GraphQL) format.
3. Stores the queryable dataset into a database for **quick and easy access**.

### What are the use cases of an indexer?

The use cases are endless. From applications like [Solana's explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/), to a decentralized exchange bot. An indexer's main goal is to extend the JSON RPC APIs available from a node, by developing additional APIs that cover a greater amount of edge cases.

:::note Examples

- Wallets, exchanges, staking providers, validators can use the Indexer to broadcast transactions and synchronize information with their customers.  
- Data aggregators and blockchain analytics firms can use the Indexer to gather data around significant events and get a better understanding of underlying causes.
