# Limitations 
1. Due to the massive amount of data Solana consumes, (approximately 10GB/min), we have decided to limit the amount of data per query to a 4 hour interval.  
2. Accounts, Tokens, Instructions and Epochs tables has not been implemented. 
3. Blocks between 60-62M & above 99.5M are avalaible, but have not caught up to the latest blocks.
 
## Solving Limitations

### Limiting Data
In time to come, we will provide an increment in the interval to paid customers. 

### Missing Tables
This is at the top of our priority to ensure all devs can query everything on the solana blockchain. 

### Catching up to the blockchain 
We have partenered up with large institutions to allow faster and larger SQL Injection and are awaiting for thier approval. Furthermore, Solana.Fm has an RPC node to extract,transform & load (ETL) data at a much faster rate.
